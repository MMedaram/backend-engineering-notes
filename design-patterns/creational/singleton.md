1. What is Singleton? (In Simple Words)

The Singleton Design Pattern means:

A class is allowed to create only one object during the entire lifetime of the application, and that same object is reused everywhere.

So instead of:

Creating a new object every time

We create one object once, and share it

Think of it like:

One central authority

Everyone refers to the same source

2. Why Do We Need Singleton?

To understand why, first understand the problem.

Without Singleton (Problem)

In a large application (like a bank):

Multiple services run at the same time

Each service may create its own object

Some objects are not meant to be duplicated

This leads to:

Wasted memory

Inconsistent data

Unexpected behavior

Performance issues

3. Banking Example (Layman Friendly)
Example: Bank Configuration

A bank has:

Interest rates

Daily transaction limits

Feature flags (enabled / disabled services)

These values:

Are same for everyone

Should be loaded once

Should not change randomly

If every service loads its own configuration:

One service may use old values

Another may use new values

This causes business inconsistency

👉 Singleton ensures one shared configuration object

4. Core Idea Behind Singleton (How It Works)

Singleton is based on three simple rules:

No one should create the object directly

Only the class itself creates the object

Everyone accesses the same object

This is achieved by:

Making constructor private

Storing the object in a static variable

Providing a static method to access it

5. Simple Example (Easy to Understand)
public class BankConfig {

    private static BankConfig instance;

    private BankConfig() {
        // private constructor
    }

    public static BankConfig getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new BankConfig();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

What is happening here?

private constructor → prevents new BankConfig()

static instance → shared across application

getInstance() → controls object creation

6. Why This Simple Version Is NOT Enough

In real systems:

Many threads run in parallel

Two threads may enter getInstance() at the same time

Both may create objects

This breaks the “only one instance” rule
⚠️ Especially dangerous in banking systems

7. Thread-Safe Singleton (Real-World Ready)
public class BankConfig {

    private static volatile BankConfig instance;

    private BankConfig() {}

    public static BankConfig getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (BankConfig.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new BankConfig();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

Extra Notes (Layman Explanation)

synchronized → only one thread enters at a time

double check → avoids unnecessary locking

volatile → ensures all threads see the same object

This version:

Is safe

Is efficient

Is commonly discussed in interviews

8. Best and Cleanest Singleton in Java (Enum)
public enum BankAuditLogger {
    INSTANCE;

    public void log(String message) {
        System.out.println("AUDIT: " + message);
    }
}

Why Enum Singleton is Preferred

Java guarantees only one enum instance

Thread-safe by default

Safe from reflection & serialization issues

Very little code

👉 Many senior developers prefer this approach

9. Singleton in Spring Boot (Very Important Reality)

In Spring Boot:

@Service
public class TransactionService {
}


By default:

Spring creates only one instance

Manages lifecycle for you

So:

You rarely write Singleton manually

You rely on Dependency Injection

👉 Singleton pattern is still important to understand, not always to implement

10. Alternatives to Singleton (Modern Approach)
Dependency Injection (Preferred)

Instead of:

BankConfig.getInstance()


We use:

@Autowired
private BankConfig bankConfig;


Why this is better:

Easy to test

Loose coupling

Cleaner design

11. When NOT to Use Singleton

Avoid Singleton when:

Object holds user-specific data

Multiple configurations are required

Unit testing becomes hard

Global state causes hidden bugs

Singleton is powerful, but dangerous if misused.

12. Common Interview Notes

Singleton controls object creation

Thread safety depends on implementation

Enum Singleton is safest

Spring beans are singleton by default

Overuse of Singleton is considered a design smell

13. One-Line Summary (Interview Ready)

Singleton ensures a single shared instance, but in modern Spring applications, dependency injection is preferred over manual Singleton implementation.
