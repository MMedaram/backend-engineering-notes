# Java 9 - Features / Enhancements

Java 9 was released on **21 September 2017**.

The biggest theme of Java 9 was **modularization**. Java moved from one large runtime image to a modular platform, and applications could also be organized as modules.

Java 9 also added many daily-use improvements in collections, streams, optional, process handling, concurrency, tooling, JVM logging, security, and packaging.

## What Java 9 Means For Backend Developers

For daily backend coding, the most useful Java 9 features are:

- Immutable collection factory methods.
- Stream and Optional enhancements.
- Better process handling for tools and infrastructure code.
- CompletableFuture timeout and delay support.
- Serialization filtering for safer legacy Java serialization.
- Module-system awareness, even if your application still runs on the classpath.

## Quick Summary

Java 9 introduced the **Java Platform Module System** as its major feature. It also added immutable collection factory methods, JShell, stream and optional improvements, private interface methods, Process API updates, Flow API, CompletableFuture enhancements, compact strings, G1 as default GC, unified JVM logging, and serialization filters.
