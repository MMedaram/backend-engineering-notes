# Abstract Factory Pattern

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** provides an interface to create **families of related objects**
without specifying their concrete classes.

If **Factory Method** creates **one product**,  
**Abstract Factory** creates **a group of related products** that are meant to work together.

---

## Why Abstract Factory Exists

Factory Method solves **object creation**, but problems appear when:

- Objects are **related**
- Objects must be **consistent with each other**
- You want to switch **entire product families** at once

Abstract Factory solves this by:
- Grouping related object creation
- Enforcing compatibility
- Avoiding scattered `if-else` logic

> **Core idea:**  
> *Create families of related objects, not individual ones.*

---

## Simple Way to Remember

| Pattern | Creates |
|------|--------|
| Factory Method | One object |
| Abstract Factory | A family of objects |

---

## Real Banking Scenario

### Scenario: Payment + Notification + Audit

Different payment channels require:
- Payment processor
- Notification service
- Audit logger

Example families:
- **UPI family**
- **CARD family**
- **NET_BANKING family**

Each family has **its own compatible implementations**.

---

## ❌ Problem Without Abstract Factory (Bad Design)

```
if (type.equals("UPI")) {
    new UpiPayment();
    new SmsNotification();
    new UpiAuditLogger();
} else if (type.equals("CARD")) {
    new CardPayment();
    new EmailNotification();
    new CardAuditLogger();
}
```

#### Problems

❌ Tight coupling   
❌ Hard to extend   
❌ Inconsistent combinations possible  
❌ Violates Open/Closed Principle  

---

## ✅ Abstract Factory Solution

### Step 1️⃣ Define Product Interfaces

```java 
public interface PaymentProcessor {
void pay();
}

public interface NotificationService {
void notifyUser();
}

public interface AuditLogger {
void log();
}
```

### Step 2️⃣ Create Abstract Factory Interface

```java
public interface BankingServiceFactory {

    PaymentProcessor createPaymentProcessor();
    NotificationService createNotificationService();
    AuditLogger createAuditLogger();
}
```

### Step 3️⃣ Create Concrete Factories

#### UPI Factory

```java 
public class UpiBankingFactory implements BankingServiceFactory {

    public PaymentProcessor createPaymentProcessor() {
        return new UpiPayment();
    }

    public NotificationService createNotificationService() {
        return new SmsNotification();
    }

    public AuditLogger createAuditLogger() {
        return new UpiAuditLogger();
    }
}
```

#### Card Factory

```java 
public class CardBankingFactory implements BankingServiceFactory {

    public PaymentProcessor createPaymentProcessor() {
        return new CardPayment();
    }

    public NotificationService createNotificationService() {
        return new EmailNotification();
    }

    public AuditLogger createAuditLogger() {
        return new CardAuditLogger();
    }
}
```

### Step 4️⃣ Use the Factory

```
BankingServiceFactory factory = new UpiBankingFactory();

factory.createPaymentProcessor().pay();
factory.createNotificationService().notifyUser();
factory.createAuditLogger().log();
```

✔ No concrete classes  
✔ Family consistency guaranteed  

---
## How This Appears in Spring

Spring implicitly uses Abstract Factory concepts:

- ApplicationContext
- BeanFactory
- Auto-configuration modules

#### Example:

- JPA starter → creates DataSource + EntityManager + TxManager
- Kafka starter → creates Producer + Consumer + Admin

👉 Starters = Abstract Factories

## Factory Method vs Abstract Factory
| Aspect      | Factory Method | Abstract Factory           |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Creates     | Single object  | Object families            |
| Complexity  | Low            | Medium                     |
| Flexibility | Moderate       | High                       |
| Usage       | Very common    | Less frequent but powerful |

---

### When to Use Abstract Factory

Use it when:  
✔ Objects must work together  
✔ Multiple configurations exist  
✔ You want to switch entire behavior sets  
✔ Consistency matters more than simplicity   

### When NOT to Use It

Avoid when:  
❌ Only one object is created  
❌ No product families exist  
❌ Over-engineering risk  

> Most applications don’t need it — but when they do, nothing else fits.

## Banking / Enterprise Examples

Real usages:

- Payment ecosystems
- Report generation (PDF / Excel / CSV families)
- Environment-based infra (DEV / PROD clients)
- Cloud provider integrations

> I used Abstract Factory to create related services like payment, notification, and audit components together. It ensured consistent combinations and made switching payment channels easy without modifying business logic.


---

## Summary

- Abstract Factory creates families of objects
- Ensures compatibility
- Promotes Open/Closed Principle
- Used heavily in frameworks like Spring
- Powerful but should be used carefully
