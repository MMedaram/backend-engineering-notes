# Well-Designed Microservices Architecture – Components List


## 1️⃣ Client Layer

- Web UI (Browser)
- Mobile App
- API Clients (Postman, internal services)

---

## 2️⃣ API Access Layer

**API Gateway**

- Request routing
- Authentication & authorization
- Rate limiting
- API versioning
- Request/response transformation

---

## 3️⃣ Identity & Security

- Authentication Service
- Authorization Service
- OAuth2 / OpenID Connect
- JWT / Token Service
- Secrets Management (Vault, KMS)

---

## 4️⃣ Microservices Layer (Core Business)

Each service typically has:

- Controller (REST)
- Service layer (business logic)
- Repository / DAO
- DTOs
- Validation
- Local transactions

#### Examples:

- Account Service
- Customer Service
- Order Service
- Payment Service
- Notification Service

---

## 5️⃣ Service-to-Service Communication

- REST (HTTP/JSON)
- gRPC
- Messaging (Kafka / RabbitMQ)
- Event-driven communication

Supporting components:

- Message broker
- Schema registry (for events)

---

## 6️⃣ Data Layer (Per Service)

- Dedicated database per service
    - RDBMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
    - NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra)

- Cache (Redis)
- Search engine (Elasticsearch)

> Rule: One database per microservice (logical ownership).

---

## 7️⃣ Transaction & Consistency

- Local ACID transactions
- Eventual consistency
- Saga pattern
- Compensating transactions
- Idempotency handling

---

## 8️⃣ Service Discovery & Configuration

- Service Registry (Discovery)
- Centralized Configuration Server
- Dynamic configuration refresh
- Feature flags

---

## 9️⃣ Resilience & Fault Tolerance

- Circuit breakers
- Retries
- Timeouts
- Bulkheads
- Rate limiting
- Fallback mechanisms

---

## 🔟 Observability & Monitoring

- Centralized logging
- Distributed tracing
- Metrics collection
- Health checks
- Alerting & dashboards

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Deployment & Runtime Platform

- Containerization (Docker)
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Load balancers
- Ingress controllers

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ CI / CD & DevOps

- Source control (Git)
- Build pipelines
- Automated testing
- Artifact repositories
- Deployment automation
- Rollback strategies

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Data & Integration Support

- ETL / Data pipelines
- Reporting services
- Batch jobs
- Scheduled jobs

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Governance & Compliance (Enterprise)

- Audit logging
- Compliance checks
- API governance
- Version control & deprecation policies

---

## In Reality

- **Small system** → use fewer components
- **Large / banking system** → most of these exist
- **Microservices ≠ using everything**

> Architecture evolves with scale and team maturity.

---


> A well-designed microservices architecture includes **API gateway, independent services with their own data stores, service communication mechanisms, resilience patterns, observability, centralized configuration, and automated deployment infrastructure**.
