# Annotations

Annotations are special markers in Java that provide **metadata about code** to the compiler or runtime.

They do not change the logic directly, but they **instruct frameworks or tools how to treat a class, method, or field.**

For example, `@Override` tells the compiler that a method overrides a parent method, and `@Component` tells Spring to manage that class as a bean.

In simple terms: **annotations give extra instructions about your code without changing its core behavior.**
